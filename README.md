# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Neural-Networks-and-Attention-Mechanisms
Advanced time series forecasting project using a Seq2Seq neural network with self-attention to predict electricity consumption. Students train, tune hyperparameters, and perform rolling origin cross-validation. Final results compare MAE, RMSE, and MAPE against baseline models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.
